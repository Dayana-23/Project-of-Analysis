# Analysis of Worldwide Suicide Rates

✤ Welcome,in this project I analyse Suicide Rates (27 820 observations) across the world during the period of 1985-2016 years.

✤ The dataset is from Kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016

✤ In general, for research the following data variables were used: country, year,gender,age ranges,suicides number,population of country, ratio of suicides for population, Human Development Index for each year, Gross domestic product value for each year and person.

✤ Together we will guess, who is more likely to attempt suicides,male or female; which country had a critical time, and factors.
