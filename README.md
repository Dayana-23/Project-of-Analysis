# Analysis of Worldwide Suicide Rates

✤ Welcome, in this project I analyse Suicide Rates (27 820 observations) across the world during the period of 1985-2016 years.

✤ The dataset is from Kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016

✤Everyone knows that suicide is related to mental health problems,it happens due to depression at work,feeling of loneliness in family, that's why they kill themselves, when they don't have any hope to live in future.
✤ In general, for research the following data variables were used: country, year,gender,age ranges,suicides number,population of country, ratio of suicides for population, Human Development Index for each year, Gross domestic product value for each year and person.

✤ Together we will guess, who is more likely to attempt suicides,male or female; which country had a critical time, and factors which influenced to dramatic changes of suicide rates.
